# organize_routes_into_individual_files (Issue)

- [x] Create a `routes` directory under `app`.
- [x] Move book-related routes to a separate `books_routes.py` file:
  - [x] Create `books_routes.py`.
  - [x] Move `books_bp` and all book-related routes.
- [x] Move user-related routes to a separate `users_routes.py` file:
  - [x] Create `users_routes.py`.
  - [x] Move `users_bp` and all user-related routes.
- [x] Update the main `__init__.py` to import and register the blueprints correctly.
- [x] Ensure all routes work correctly by running the test suite.
